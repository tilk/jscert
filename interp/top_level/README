---------------------------
Installation and launching:
---------------------------

The toplevel is built during a standard make. The binary is placed in /interp.

From the /interp directory,
- [ledit] ./top


--------------
How to use it:
--------------

Input to the toplevel can span several lines. It is terminated by an empty line.
Example:

< b = (1 == true)
< 
normal; Coq_resvalue_value: true


The following directives control the toplevel behavior.
Note: all directives start with a # (sharp) symbol.

#dump: dump the memory state
#load: load a file and launch the interpreter
#reset: reset the state to the initial state
#step: step-by-step mode available
#unstep: step-by-step mode disable


/!\ : Relative addresses are used by the program. Be cautious
if you want to move files.
