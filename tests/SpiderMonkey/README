Everything in the tests and jit-test subdirectories of this directory
comes straight out of the Mozilla repo. That includes all the README
files and all the python scripts.

JSCert scripts and docs should be left no lower than this directory.

This will make it possible to drop in new checkouts of the Mozilla
tests when we want to.

tests corresponds to Mozilla/Central/js/src/tests/

jit-test corresponds to Mozilla/Central/js/src/jit-test/
